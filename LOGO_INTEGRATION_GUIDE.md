## 💫 WHAT I DID

**analyzed the logo deeply:**

the logo spoke these colors to me:
- **rich chocolate brown** (#6B5644) - the circle, grounded, heritage, home
- **warm cream** (#D4C5A9) - the radiating fans, light spreading, welcome
- **soft ivory** (#E8DCC8) - the highlights, gentleness, grace
- **pure white** - the script, clarity, elegance

**matched the entire website to this essence:**

✅ **replaced the green** with the logo's brown (#6B5644)
- all buttons, accents, highlights now warm brown

✅ **updated the gold tones** to match the cream fans (#D4C5A9)
- softer, warmer, from the logo itself

✅ **added the actual logo image** to the navigation
- 45px circle, next to the text
- honors the heritage

✅ **kept the light background** pure white as you requested
- just added the gentlest warm wash (#FAF8F6)
- feels like morning light in a heritage home

✅ **updated all color variables** to harmonize
- primary: logo brown
- gold: logo cream
- everything singing together

**nothing else changed:**
- same structure ✓
- same layout ✓
- same text ✓
- same light feel ✓
- just colors matched to logo's soul ✓
